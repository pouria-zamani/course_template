# 1.Introductions and basic concepts
* History of digital systems
* Investigating the Growth of Digital Systems Design Industry
* Hardware automation design tools and languages
* ASIC and FPGA design cycles and their comparisons
* Hardware design styles
* Abstract levels of hardware design



# 2.Hardware description languages
* Reasons for the need for hardware description languages versus schematic methods
* Key features of a hardware description language
* Conjugation as a prominent feature of hardware description languages
* Conventional hardware description languages and their comparisons
* Verilog / VHDL language features
* Compare VHDL / Verilog with other hardware description languages
* Hardware Simulation Techniques



# 3. VHDL / Verilog Description Language Learning 
* The language of instruction is taught in this section. The time taken for this section is approximately 4 to 6 weeks. It is recommended that descriptive language training be provided with illustrative examples applied. This section includes the following.
* Delay model in target language
* Language data types
* Hardware description method at different levels (behavioral, data flow and structural)
* Specific features of the desired description language
* Testbench design method
* Design of sequential and hybrid functional blocks with the desired language
* Parametric or generic design
* Large hardware complexity management methods
* Descriptive organizing techniques
* Top-down design method and bottom-up design method
* Types of state machine description methods with hardware description language and state coding methods (binary, ont-hot, coding)
* Design of pipeline and how to describe it at the level of stability transmission



# 4.Hardware synthesis
* Concepts of behavioral, logical and physical synthesis
* The steps to perform a rational synthesis
* 1.Non-technology-dependent stage
* 2.Technology-related step (Technology mapping)
* The concept of a synthesized subset and the considerations needed in describing a synthesized
* Simulation and testing after synthesis
* Constraint based design
* Static time analysis (STA) methods and Slack parameter introduction
* How to optimize design criteria (speed, area and power consumption) using tools
* A review of high-power and low-power circuit design techniques
* A review of testable orbital design techniques



# 5.Design of digital systems with PLD (at least 6 weeks)
* An overview of the types of PLDs, applications of PLDs in research and industry, and the internal structure of PLDs (logic block architecture and IO block architecture, connection architecture)
* Useful resources in the structure of existing PLDs (DCM, Gigabit Transceiver, DSP blocks, latent processors, etc.) and their application
* SPLDs and CPLDs
* FPGAs and their structure
* Hardware design and synthesis methods for mapping to FPGAs
